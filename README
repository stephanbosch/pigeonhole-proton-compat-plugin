Sieve Proton Compatibility plugin for Pigeonhole Sieve v3.0

Introduction
------------

Sieve (RFC 5228) is a highly extensible machine language specifically tailored
for internet message filtering. For the Dovecot Secure IMAP server, Sieve
support is provided by the Pigeonhole Sieve plugin. This package extends
Pigeonhole with support for the vendor-specific Sieve language extensions as
used by the Proton implementation of Sieve. The goal of this plugin is to
provide sufficient compatibility to be able to run typical Sieve scripts
originally written for Proton deployments.

Support for the vnd.proton.expire extension is added by this plugin. The plugin
adds support for all of the tests and actions defined for this extension.
However, the message will not actually expire when the expire action is
executed.

The vnd.proton.eval extension is currently not implemented.
