Compiling
---------

If you downloaded this package using Mercurial, you have a script called
autogen.sh in your source tree. You should execute that first:

./autogen.sh

After this executed successfully or when you downloaded the tarball,
configure needs to be executed with the following parameters:

  --with-dovecot=<path>
    Path to the dovecot-config file. This can either be a compiled dovecot
    source tree or point to the location where the dovecot-config file is
    installed on your system (typically in the $prefix/lib/dovecot directory).

  --with-pigeonhole=<path>
    Path to the Pigeonhole headers. If the --with-dovecot parameter points to
    the path where dovecot-config is installed on your system, this parameter is
    usually not necessary. This parameter may either point to the a Pigeonhole
    source tree or the location where the Pigeonhole headers are installed on
    your system.

When these paremeters are omitted, the configure script will try to find a
Dovecot installation implicitly.

For example, when compiling against compiled Dovecot and Pigeonhole sources:

./configure --with-dovecot=../dovecot-3.0 \
  --with-pigeonhole=../dovecot-3.0-pigeonhole

Or when compiling against a Dovecot installation:

./configure --with-dovecot=/usr/local/lib/dovecot

As usual, to compile and install, execute the following:

make
sudo make install

Configuration
-------------

This package builds and installs the sieve_proton_compat plugin for Pigeonhole
Sieve. The plugin itself is activated by adding it to the sieve_plugins setting:

sieve_plugins {
  sieve_proton_compat = yes
}

This plugin registers the following extensions with the Sieve interpreter:

   vnd.proton.expire

These extensions are not enabled by default and thus need to be enabled
explicitly, which means that these extensions need to be added to the
"sieve_extensions" setting.

Example:

sieve_scipt personal {
  driver = file
  type = personal
  path = ~/.dovecot.sieve
}

sieve_plugins {
  sieve_proton_compat = yes
}

sieve_extensions {
  vnd.proton.expire = yes
}
